Format: 

Classes: For rules i use Upercase in the first lether to construct a class

Methods:i use parenthesis in the methods when instance some value

Variables, Getter/Setter: like to use user attr_... becouse is short key,
but i have a some problems to see when i need to use attr_. I think i like 
to conbine use getter/setter attr_writer/attr_setter and attr_accesses 

if condition: i use Control Statementsshort-if expression becouse is more fast and 
easy to use
